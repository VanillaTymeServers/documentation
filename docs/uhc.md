# UHC Server

The world border will be increased by 500, an equivilant of 1500 blocks on all directions. As well as the time of the uhc has been increased to 2 hours so that the border does not move at light speed with the border being further.  When the game starts pvp will be disabled for the first 10 minutes, after that it will be enabled. Enemy nametags are disabled. The world border starts shrinking at the 30 minute mark and stops shrinking at 50 blocks from 0,0. If the two hours run out and there are still teams alive a deathmatch will begin. You will have 5 minutes to kill each other.

## Rules

- You have to have a vanilla minecraft launcher no uhc special launchers.
- NO MODS, Except for Optifine and Simple Voice Chat. You many not use any minimap mod. This is final no ifs but and what ifs. 
- As well if you are caught using any hacks xray or anything that breaks any of our Vanilla Tyme official rules you will be banned from the server and a ban appeal will have to be done. 
- NO ghosting, meaning when you die you cant spy on other teams/players and tell your team mate. That is why we will have a separate discord channel for those that die to conversate together.

There will be a private discord channel for each team (teams of 2) Only the members of that team are allowed to be in there. If you die you are to part from your team's discord channel and go to a designated Death Lobby channel
MORE INFO

-Day and night cycle is turned on.
-When you kill a player they drop a player head, you can right click that head in your hand looking at an air block (DO NOT PLACE IT) when consumed your teams will get regeneration for 5 seconds.
