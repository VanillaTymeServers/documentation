# Collectible & Tophies

## What are collectibles?  

Collectibles are special items that you can obtain from voting and turn in to get various perks.  Some collectibles have special desirable characteristics that cannot be obtained in vanilla Minecraft while others are just for show.  All Collectibles can be identified by the “Collectible” text in the lore of the item.  Collectibles are commonly traded, bought, and sold between players.

All staff have a collectible named for them.  Players have the ability to get a collectible named for them by winning early map competitions or by turning in sets of collectibles (more details below).

## What are trophies? 

Trophies (previously known as ***event collectibles***) are special items awarded to players.  Trophies can commonly be obtained as milestone voting swords (every 50 votes), holiday gifts, event gifts, competition prizes, weekly competition prizes, mini-game winner prizes and more. 

All Trophies can be identified by the *“Trophy”* text in the lore of the item.  Like collectibles, trophies are commonly traded, bought, and sold between players in game. 

5 Trophies can be traded in for one Collectible.  Contact a staff member in game or through discord support when you are ready to trade the trophies in.  You will be given a RANDOM Collectible.
