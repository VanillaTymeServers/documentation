# Build Competitions
Our community offers build competitions every month. Each build competition will be announced in our Discord server, in the #comps-and-events channel. Build competitions start on the first of the month, and players are allowed to submit builds throughout the month until submissions are closed. Details are always provided in the forum post for each month, but typically players have from the first to around the 25th of each month to submit a build. 

## Your Submission
All submissions must be built on our creative plots server (play.vanillatymeservers.com), head through the creative plots portal.
The build must stay within a 32x32x64 block area on the player’s plot. 
Each player is allowed 1 submission with a maximum of 2 screenshots. Post them in the build comp Discord channel (ex: #january-build-comp).
Players are also encouraged to include a description of their build, or plot coordinates so other players may view their build. 

## Voting
Voting begins after submissions close. This is announced in the #comps-and-events channel each month around the 25th.
Depending on how many build submissions there are for that month’s theme, players will be allowed to vote for either their single favorite build, or their top 3, whichever is stated in the voting announcement. 
Players may vote for their own build, or someone else’s. Players are not allowed to encourage others to vote for a specific build. Votes are counted by viewing the number of reactions on each submission.

## Prizes
Whoever has the most votes (reactions) will win the build competition. 
Every player who submits a build will receive a participation trophy.
The winner will receive the BuildChamp tag in game, a shulker full of goodies customized for that month’s theme, and a winner trophy. The BuildChamp tag lasts for 1 month.
