# Vanilla Tyme Events (Mini-Games)

## Events Host
I am exodus2727 one of the moderators of Vanilla Tyme Servers, as well as my typical moderator duties I focus on hosting the Mini-games Events and building new games. I am from the UK and have been playing Minecraft for over 10 years. My favorite part of the game is building.
What are mini games
Mini-games is an event that typically runs on Saturdays around 12:00-13:00 Eastern Time. The games typically last for 1 hour. It is a chance for all players to play mini-games against each other. I try to run the games every other week but it depends on my work and player demand for the event to run. The games are located near spawn and you can request a TP to the area if you wish to play. There is a locker room for you to store all your items and spare food and totems. 

There are a variety of classic Minecraft Mini-games built by myself or other VTS moderators in survival. And the winner of each game will get a prize that includes a trophy which can be traded in for collectables. In addition if you want to donate materials to the games area or help with building any of the games I would be really grateful, and you would get a trophy as a token of my appreciation.
## What games are there
Here is an example of some of the mini-games we typically play
### Fishing
Everyone grabs a ‘Fishing Contest’ fishing rod. Do NOT start fishing until I say so. The goal of fishing is to catch tropical fish (nemo, the orange one). Once you’ve caught the fish you must announce in chat that you have it (“I got it!”). 
### Boogie Boats
Sometimes referred to as musical minecarts, this mini-game is like musical chairs. Everyone dances around the board and when the music stops you try to get into a boat. Each round a boat will be removed and the last person remaining wins.
### Boat Race
The goal is to be the first around 1 lap. No punching. If you get knocked out of your boat, get back in it. 
### Dropper
The goal of the dopper is to jump into a deep hole and avoid the obstacles and make it into the water blocks below. This is repeated and the winner is the last person remaining.
### Connect 4
It's Connect 4 but in Minecraft.
### Archery
The goal of this game is to hit all the target blocks, the fastest player wins.
### King of the Ladder
The goal of King of the Ladder is to be the last person at the top of the ladder. Punch others off the ladder/top ice and be the last one on. If you fall off you can try to climb the ladder again. After some time I will say STOP and if you fall off you can no longer try to climb the ladder and the last person at the top wins.
### Spleef
In Spleef players destroy blocks below other players, trying to get them to fall off the playing field. The last person remaining wins.
## What's going to happen in the new season
Next season I will be building a whole new games area, so it might be some time before all the classic games are up and running. If you want to donate materials or help build the games I would be very grateful.

Something new I am trying for this season is to have ‘game-plots’ theses are marked out areas for players to build their own games. If you have an idea for a game that you want to build so other people can play it during the mini-games let me know! I'll ask you to build a mockup in creative and if I approve it you can build it at the games area.
